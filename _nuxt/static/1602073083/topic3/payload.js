Within the stream of Personal Health Records, various approaches to a more patient-oriented data collection approach have been investigated. Specifically, within The Netherlands, recent MedMij grants have boosted PGOs in this context. However, the PGO market is relatively immature. Furthermore, within research settings, scholars often need flexibility to experiment with novel data collection approaches. At the same time, adherence to European values and legislation puts pressure on this desired flexibility. Therefore, within this working group, we propose to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing and planned solutions. We also propose to provide mutual access to the experimental data collection platforms of the various funded projects within Commit2Data."}]},{type:b,value:f},{type:a,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:b,value:"Further reading: "},{type:a,tag:e,props:{href:h,rel:["nofollow","noopener","noreferrer"],target:"_blank"},children:[{type:b,value:h}]}]}]},dir:"\u002Ftopics",path:"\u002Ftopics\u002Ftopic3",extension:".md",slug:"topic3",createdAt:i,updatedAt:i}}],fetch:[],mutations:void 0}}("element","text","topic-description","Topic description","a","\n","p","https:\u002F\u002Fis.ieis.tue.nl\u002Fphierp20\u002F","2020-10-07T12:17:05.664Z")));
