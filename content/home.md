# Welcome to Big Data and Health topic bazaar
The purpose of this page is to stimulate exchange of ideas between participants in projects under the Data2Person and BigData&Health projects. All project participants are invited to discuss in this forum their ideas on topics related to data/infrastructure aspects of these projects. These could lead to create cross project collaborative working groups.
