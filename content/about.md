# About page

The Data2Person and Big Data & Health projects all have their challenges (e.g. data sharing and handling). Although sometimes you might think that you are the only one with a technical problem, there might just be someone out there that has a similar problem. We want to ask you to share your challenges and solutions, so that everyone can learn from each otherâ€™s best practices and pit-falls. 

## Why would I join?
To realize reusable and sustainable scientific and technological solutions that will remain in use after your research programme has ended. This objective will require solutions to be wider applicable then in one project alone, and so by means of the bazaar projects can already start to collaborate outside their own consortium towards as generic as possible solutions.
                                                         
## How do I join?

If you are interested in any of the topics proposed, you can leave comments in the interactive document and discuss your ideas with others. If you would like to suggest the creation of a new topic, use the form in the bazaar and start a new discussion. Your topic suggestion will be moderated by the bazaar moderators and will be posted in this page as soon as possible.

## What will happen with the topics?
For now we are planning to deepen some of the topics together with some experts on **November 17, 2020**. Which exact form this meeting will have is still open for discussion.
