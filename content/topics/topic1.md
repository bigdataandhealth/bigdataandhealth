## Topic description

Software requires maintenance. If unmaintained, software degrades overtime and eventually stops working. For research software, this is a great risk as it means that research is no longer reproducible. To prevent software from being abandoned and unmaintained after the life time of a project, it is important to ensure that software will continue to be maintained -- that it will be sustainable.

I propose the creation of a working group which will take care of the medium and long term sustainability of all software developed in Big Data & Health projects.
