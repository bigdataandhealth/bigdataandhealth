## Topic description

In order to get a holistic view of patients, a hospital-centered approach to data collection is questionable since (1) for many chronic diseases, patients spend a relatively small time within the physical boundaries of hospitals, (2) EMR vendors do not provide state-of-the-art home monitoring technologies, and (3) when only starting data collection upon hospital admission one is often too late. Within the stream of Personal Health Records, various approaches to a more patient-oriented data collection approach have been investigated. Specifically, within The Netherlands, recent MedMij grants have boosted PGOs in this context. However, the PGO market is relatively immature. Furthermore, within research settings, scholars often need flexibility to experiment with novel data collection approaches. At the same time, adherence to European values and legislation puts pressure on this desired flexibility. Therefore, within this working group, we propose to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of existing and planned solutions. We also propose to provide mutual access to the experimental data collection platforms of the various funded projects within Commit2Data.
