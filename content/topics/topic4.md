## Topic description

We all aim for solutions that ultimately benefit patients' health. In the Perfect Fit project, we want to facilitate smoking cessation and physical activity in people at risk of CVD, who are likely to have lower socio-economic status background, limited (e)health literacy and so on. We want to involve individuals from the target group throughout the project and look forward to exchanging ideas and best practices with other consortia.
